"I'm devastated by Lily's passing. We may have had our differences, but she was still a friend. After Robert, my ex-boyfriend and Lily became engaged, I tried to distance myself from her life. We haven't spoken much in the past six months, so I'm completely in the dark about what happened to her."

"Lily was everything to me, the love of my life. Her passing has shattered me beyond words. I am utterly devastated by her death. She was such a kind and gentle soul, always caring for others before herself. She didn't deserve this, none of this. I pray that the authorities find out who did this to her soon. Lily deserves justice, and her memory should be honored with the truth coming to light."

"Mr.Ethan Clay has refused to speak"  
- Ethan's assitant

"Ethan? Yeah, he's a smart one. Always knew when to keep his mouth shut. When the detectives came around asking questions, he wouldn't say a word without his lawyer present. Can't blame him, really. In this day and age, you can't be too careful. But I can tell you this, he's not one to shy away from a challenge. He's built 'Blitz' from the ground up, and he's not about to let anyone tear it down. Whatever happened that night, I doubt he had anything to do with it. He's a businessman, not a criminal."

Testimonial 4:

"I've seen Mr. Oliver quite often, you know, going towards the maid's house where she lives. Can't say for sure what business he has there, but it's not something you'd expect from a man in his position. Lily, rest her soul, was a bit too arrogant for my taste, always strutting about like she owned the place. Wouldn't be surprised if she made a few enemies along the way. And that young Gabriel, the delivery boy, was here just the other morning, on the day when poor Lily passed away, making a ruckus about Lily calling the cops on him. Not a pleasant sight, I must say. Oh, and speaking of Madeline, I Can't help but think there's something going on between Oliver and her, if you catch my drift. And on the night of the murder, I saw a shadowy figure lurking around the neighborhood, just before everything happened. Gave me quite a start, it did."

Testimonial 5:

"Lily, my love, is a kind soul, a beautiful human being, an angel sent from heaven. I was a fool to suspect her of cheating on me; she'd never do such a thing. Our argument that morning was heated, fueled by my unfounded jealousy and insecurity. I regret every harsh word spoken in anger, now knowing that it would be our last interaction. Lily didn't deserve my mistrust; she deserved only love and respect. Her death has shattered me, leaving a void in my heart that can never be filled. I pray that the truth comes to light soon, that her killer is brought to justice. Lily deserves justice, and I will do everything in my power to ensure it is served."

Testimonial 6:

"I've been estranged from my daughter since her childhood, and I hoped to redeem myself by reentering her life. But what happened to her is beyond imagination. I strongly suspect that bast*rd Ethan is behind this, but I won't let his master plan succeed. I will step into Lily's place at Blitz and ensure that Ethan is kicked out from the company."  
- Oliver

Testimonial 7:

"I can't believe she's gone. The dispute we had, it's got nothing to do with her death. I've changed my ways, trying to stay away from all that gang stuff. There's no way I'd go back to that life by doing something like this. I just hope they find out who did it and get them off the streets." 
- Delivery Driver Gabriel

Testimonial 8:

"I've been with Lily since she was a baby, and I can tell you, she was a good girl. Always respectful and kind-hearted. But the day she died, it was like everything went wrong for her. Gabriel, the delivery boy, was here in the morning, and they were fighting. Then later, she had a big fight with her fianc√©. And I overheard her arguing with someone on the phone too. It was a bad day for Lily, she was fighting with people all day.
On the day of the murder, I heard a sound from Lily's room. When I rushed there, I saw someone running away. By the time I reached Lily, she was soaked in a pool of blood. I immediately called the ambulance.It was around 7:45 P.M."

Testimonial 9:

"The family hasn't been the same since mom passed away. Dad, was always working, never really around. Lily, she's a strong girl, had to be with no mom around and dad always busy. But it's been tough on all of us. Lily, she didn't deserve what happened to her. She was a good girl, always trying to keep the peace, even when things got rough. She needs justice, whoever did this needs to be brought to justice. She was my sister, and I've been missing her every day."  
- Lucas
